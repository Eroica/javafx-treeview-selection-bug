= JavaFX TreeView selection bug

This application demonstrates a bug in TreeView’s `selectionModel` involving multiple selections.

'''

The layout of the application is this:

A TreeView in the center contains a list of String items.
The labels on the bottom are bound to display the current state of the TreeView’s `selectionModel`.
The button on the top is set to remove the selected item (if there is any).

It is important to note that items can be focused, but unselected.
This is why the labels at the bottom also include `focusedItem`, and which will become useful to work around the following bugs.

(I’m using _left_ and _right_ here along with AsciiDoc’s inline images so that the screenshots are put on a single line. Depending on your screen size, the images might appear below each other.)

== Bug #1: De-selecting with Ctrl-click

The first bug occurs when shrinking the selection by Ctrl-clicking on an item.
Here is what happens when I select a single item (left) and then de-select it:

As expected, since nothing is selected, `selectedItem` is `null` and `selectedItems` (plural) is empty.

However, if the selection includes multiple items, de-selecting either the first or last item leads to something different from what the user sees.
Compare the initial selection (left) with the state after I de-selected the 3rd item (right):

`selectedItem` and `selectedItems` (plural) seem to contradict each other:
`selectedItems` (plural) only show 1 and 2 selected (which is also what the user sees), but `selectedItem` is still set to the 3rd item.

=== Bisection

I couldn’t try any JavaFX earlier than version 11, and it seems this bug is still present there.

=== Workaround

== Bug #2: Removing elements from the beginning or end

First the correct behavior: I select 3 items (left) from the top to the bottom so that the 3rd item is the `selectedItem`.
Then I click on the button to remove it (right):

As expected, `selectedItem` jumps to the 2nd item (which has become the final item of the selection), and `selectedItems` (plural) only contains two items.

However, when the selection includes the last item of the list, removing it leads to a contradictory state again.
First, I selected the last items from top to bottom (i.e. the 7th item is the `selectedItem`).
Then I let the 7th item be removed:

While `selectedItems` (plural) correctly shows that 7 does not exist anymore, `selectedItem` is still incorrectly set to 7.
`focusedItem` behaves correctly and sets the focus to the new final item.

This bug happens in a similar way if the selection includes the very first item, i.e. selecting from the bottom to top (left) and then removing the first item (right):

=== Bisection

While I didn’t try any earlier JavaFX version than 11, the bug seems to have different stages:

* In JavaFX 11 to 18, including the final item and then removing it correctly updates `selectedItem`.
**  However, including the first item (bottom to top) and removing it showcases the bug.
* Beginning with JavaFX 19, the bug also occurs with the final item.

=== Workaround
